# Print History

Fluidd supports Moonrakers Print History component. This allows you to
view print history, but more importantly - lets you sort your jobs by last
print date, filter jobs you've already printed and view printer statistics
over time - like total print time, total filament used.

Secondarily, being able to re-print failed or cancelled jobs also comes with
this feature.

For the moment, Fluidd loads the last 50 prints from history. The limit is
10,000 history items - however, loading this up front may cause a performance
hit and is likely unecessary.

Feedback is welcome on the current state of this feature!
