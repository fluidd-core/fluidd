Fluidd support turning your macros on and off, and categorizing them. You can
also hide macros from Fluidd entirely by prefixing their name with an
underscore (`_`). 

To move a macro to a category, you first create a category in the settings menu, 
then left-click on a macro in an existing category. This will bring up a menu 
where you can select the category your macro will be in as well as change the color.
