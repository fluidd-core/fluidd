Fluidd (and FluiddPI) has built in support for web cameras and allows configuring
your cameras from the same place as your other configuration files.

To get started, open the `webcam.txt` config file in Fluidd's configuration editor.
Instructions on how to get started as well as option references are included in this file.

You can add up to four cameras to display on your dashboard.

Currently supported types are:

- MJPEG Stream  
  This is the traditional mjpegstream service. The service pushes images to
  fluidd at the configured resolution and FPS you have setup. This requires
  a lot of bandwidth, and can cause issues with unstable network connections.

- MJPEG Adaptive  
  This will PULL images from the mjpegstream service, using the snapshot URL.
  You can set a target FPS, and your browser will try to keep up with the
  intended target. This can be a more reliable approach for some.

- IP Camera  
  This is an experimental option. Effectively, it swaps out the `<img>` tag
  for a `<video>` tag. You should only use this if you can provide a URL
  that supports native HTML5 video tags.

- HTTP Page  
  Loads a website and displays it in place of the camera feed.
  This lets you embed any web video feed not supported by the methods mentioned above.

Head on over to the UI Settings page to define your cameras.

# Setting up multiple cameras on FluiddPi

Up to four cameras are supported by the stock configuration.
In order to make them work, you need to

1. Copy the `webcam.txt` configuration file into a new one 
   matching the `webcam*.txt` wildcard.
   Make sure each configuration file points to a different camera.
   For example, one configuration file might have `camera="usb"` and
   the other one `camera="auto"`.
   Make any other adjustments if needed.
3. Make sure each configuration file has a different port settings.
   By default `mjpg_streamer` will listen on port `8080`.
   Up to four cameras are supported by the default nginx configuration,
   from port `8080` to `8083`. Configure it by setting up
   the `camera_http_options` parameter.
   Example: `camera_http_options="-n -p 8081"`
4. Restart webcamd either via the tools drawer in the top right of the UI
   or via SSH: `sudo systemctl restart webcamd`.
   Alternatively, you could restart your device.
6. Add a new camera in the fluidd web interface.
   Camera URL should be `webcam1/?action=stream` for the streamer on port 8081;
   `webcam2/?action=stream` for port 8082;
   `webcam3/?action=stream` for port 8083.
