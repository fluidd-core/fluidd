Fluidd offers robust support for displaying camera streams, providing users
with real-time monitoring capabilities for their 3D printing projects.

The current supported types are:

- **MJPEG Stream**  
  - Traditional mjpegstream/ustreamer service.
  - Pushes images to Fluidd at the configured resolution and FPS.
  - Requires substantial bandwidth and may encounter issues with unstable
    network connections.

- **MJPEG Adaptive**  
  - Pulls images from the mjpegstream/ustreamer service using the snapshot URL.
  - Allows setting a target FPS, enabling your browser to maintain the intended
    frame rate.
  - A more reliable approach in certain scenarios.

- **HLS Stream**  
  - Loads an HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) video stream via [HLS.js](https://hlsjs.video-dev.org/).
  - Utilizes HTML5 video and MediaSource Extensions for playback, requiring a
    modern browser.

- **WebRTC (camera-streamer)**
  - A highly bandwidth-efficient stream type.
  - **IMPORTANT:** Currently only available on Raspberry devices.

- **IP Camera**  
  - Experimental option replacing the `<img>` tag with a `<video>` tag.
  - Use only if your provided URL supports native HTML5 video tags.

- **HTTP Page**  
  - Loads a website, displaying it in place of the camera feed.
  - Allows embedding any web video feed not supported by the aforementioned
    methods.
