Fluidd is equipped with robust localization features to cater to diverse user preferences.

By default, Fluidd adopts the language set in your browser. If needed, you have the flexibility to override this by specifying a preferred language through interface settings.

For those who want to contribute and enhance Fluidd's multilingual support, detailed information on localization and translation contributions is available in the [developer localization](/development/localization) docs.
