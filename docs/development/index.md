## Dev Container in Visual Studio Code

Fluidd includes a Dev Container configuration to easily open with Visual Studio Code
(VSCode) and have every tool and dependency installed.

### Install Visual Studio Code

Make sure to also install the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
extension so that VSCode knows how to use the Dev Container configuration.

### Install Docker

Follow the instruction from [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install.

### Open the Dev Container

At this point all you need to do is open Fluidd folder in VSCode and you should see a
popup indicating that it found a Dev Container configuration file; click the "Reopen in
Container" to have everything configured.

The configuration includes a container running [docker-klipper-simulavr](https://github.com/pedrolamas/docker-klipper-simulavr),
a virtualized Klipper and Moonraker image that makes it easy to debug without a real
printer.
