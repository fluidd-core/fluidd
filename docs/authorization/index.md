Fluidd supports JWT authorization through moonrakers authentication endpoints.

## Setup

- If you have a fluiddpi install from version 1.15+, then simply add a new user
with Fluidd, after which time you'll be prompted for authorization.

- If you have an older fluiddpi install,  add `force_logins` to your moonraker configuration. After restarting moonraker, add a user.

```sh
 [authorization]
 force_logins: true
```

## Forced Logins?

1. With `forced_logins` set to `true` and with no users defined - moonraker defaults
to your `trusted_clients:` setup.

2. With `forced_logins` set to `true` and with one or more users defined - moonraker
will ignore your `trusted_clients:` setup, and require authorization credentials.

3. With `forced_logins` set to `false`, moonraker will always rely on your
`trusted_clients:` setup first.

Under default conditions, a fresh installation would have your client trusted.
You can confirm this by noting your currently authenticated user.

## Lost password?

Lost your only password? You need to revert to a trusted setup. You can do this
by editing your `moonraker.conf` and turning `forced_logins` to `false`.

## LDAP - Configuration

Need central authorization? Configure LDAP to include your authentication server.
Remove `trusted_clients:` from `[authorization]` to force authentication.
You can also modify `default_source` to change the default login interface to `ldap`. The rest of the configuration can be found here:

```sh
 [secrets]
 secrets_path: ~/pathto/moonraker_secure.json
 # For security reasons this file must be located in a different 
 # folder than `moonraker.conf`.
 # ~ e.g. ~/klipper_secure/moonraker_secure.json

 [ldap]
 ldap_host: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx or fqdn
 #   The host address of the LDAP server.  This parameter must be provided
 ldap_port: 636
 #   The LDAP server's port.  The default is 389 for standard connections
 #   and 636 for SSL/TLS connections.
 ldap_secure: True
 #   Enables LDAP over SSL/TLS. The default is False.
 base_dn: DC=example,DC=local
 #   The base distinguished name used to search for users on the server.
 #   This option accepts Jinja2 Templates, see the [secrets] section for details.
 #   This parameter must be provided.
 bind_dn: {secrets.ldap_credentials.bind_dn}
 #   The distinguished name for bind authentication.  For example:
 #       CN=moonraker,OU=Users,DC=ldap,DC=local
 #   This option accepts Jinja2 Templates, see the [secrets] section for
 #   details.  By default the ldap client will attempt to bind anonymously.
 bind_password: {secrets.ldap_credentials.bind_password}
 #   The password for bind authentication. This option accepts Jinja2 Templates,
 #   see the [secrets] section for details.  This parameter must be provided
 #   if a "bind_dn" is specified, otherwise it must be omitted.
 group_dn: CN=exampleGroup,OU=exampleOU,DC=example,DC=local
 #   A group distinguished name in which the user must be a member of to pass
 #   authentication.  This option accepts Jinja2 Templates, see the [secrets]
 #   section for details. The default is no group requirement.
 is_active_directory: True
 #   Enables support for Microsoft Active Directory.  The default is False.
